# There are two sections:
#   * default: this is default options for sending message to slack.
#   * rules: list of rules for matching email message. Currently 'from',
#            'to' and 'subject' fields are supported. Their values can be
#            regexp to match corresponding email field.
#
# Each rule in list tested in order. First matched rule is used to update
# values from 'default' section with its 'options' subsection.
